# Key Lessons - Collaboration and Work Habits

## 1. Question Assumptions in Documentation

**Lesson**: Don't assume documentation examples represent the only valid use case.

**Context**: Repository examples showed localhost configurations, but the user had a valid remote deployment scenario.

**Takeaway**: 
- Always consider the user's actual deployment context
- Examples are starting points, not prescriptive requirements
- Cloud/remote deployments are as valid as local development setups

## 2. Listen to User Insights

**Lesson**: When users question something, they often have valid reasons.

**Example**: "So what's the point of public domain deployment if I need to make a localhost connection?"

**Value**: This question immediately highlighted that the initial fix suggestion was missing the point. The user understood their architecture better than the generic examples suggested.

## 3. Minimal Changes First

**Lesson**: Start with the smallest possible change when fixing configuration issues.

**Applied**: Changed only the server name from `graphiti-kb` to `graphiti` rather than rewriting the entire configuration.

**Benefits**:
- Preserves user's intentional setup
- Easier to rollback if needed
- Helps identify the specific issue

## 4. Context Matters More Than Convention

**Lesson**: Understanding the user's deployment architecture is more important than following repository conventions.

**Insight**: The user had a remote MCP server at `kb.agent-anywhere.com`, making localhost examples irrelevant.

**Application**: Focus on what the user is trying to achieve, not what the documentation suggests.

## 5. Error Messages Can Be Misleading

**Lesson**: Generic validation errors don't always point to the real issue.

**Case**: "Does not adhere to MCP server configuration schema" could mean many things:
- Wrong field names
- Missing fields
- Invalid values
- Client-specific requirements

**Approach**: Investigate multiple possibilities rather than assuming the obvious.

## 6. Documentation Serves Different Audiences

**Lesson**: Repository documentation often focuses on development setup, not production deployment.

**Reality Check**:
- Most examples assume local development
- Production deployments have different needs
- Users may be several steps ahead of basic examples

## 7. Collaborative Debugging Process

**Effective Pattern**:
1. Understand the error
2. Research existing patterns
3. Recognize user's actual goal
4. Propose minimal solution
5. Explain reasoning
6. Implement fix

**Key**: Each step involves learning from the user's feedback and adjusting approach.

## 8. Value of Knowledge Persistence

**Lesson**: Documenting solutions helps future developers and AI assistants.

**Practice**: Creating structured documentation for:
- What was done (tasks)
- How to fix issues (troubleshooting)
- What was learned (lessons)

**Benefit**: Builds institutional knowledge that persists beyond single interactions.

## 9. Remote-First Thinking

**Lesson**: Modern deployments often prioritize cloud/remote services over local installations.

**Implications**:
- Configuration should support remote endpoints naturally
- Local development is just one deployment model
- Public URLs indicate production-ready services

## 10. Trust User Expertise

**Lesson**: Users often understand their infrastructure better than generic documentation assumes.

**Respect**: When a user questions a suggestion, it's usually based on valid architectural decisions they've made.

**Response**: Adjust recommendations to fit their architecture rather than forcing standard patterns.
